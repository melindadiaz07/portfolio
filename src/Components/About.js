   After working for years as a metalsmith and running a creative business, I fell in love with coding while building my company’s website. I’d planned to throw it together with a template, but being a perfectionist with a very specific design in mind, I ended up creating it from scratch - and learning a lot about programming.
<br /><br />
   As a designer, I was initially drawn to front-end development (HTML/CSS and Javascript), but after learning Ruby and creating my own Rails-based API I quickly found backend development just as rewarding - I’m constantly amazed at how something as seemingly logic-based as writing code actually involves a tremendous amount of creativity. It’s the perfect blend of right and left brain problem solving, and I can't get enough of learning new ways to work with different languages and frameworks.
<br /><br />
   I have experience working with Javascript, HTML/CSS, React, Redux, Vue, React Native, Typescript, Ruby/Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and REST APIs. I’m very interested in working with and learning design principles to keep my code well-organized, like the MVC design pattern. As a lifelong learner, I always have a new language (or 3) I’m learning - currently I’m studying Python and C#.</h3>
